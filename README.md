===========================================
You have been contracted by an accounting company to develop a web-application to allow their customers to enter their invoice details.

For each invoice the application should record: the invoice value, the date the invoice should be paid, the name of the customer the invoice was raised against, and a description of the service the invoice was for.

The application should also allow the customers to update an existing invoice with the date it was paid.

The application should show a summary of the invoices recorded, categorised by their paid status.
